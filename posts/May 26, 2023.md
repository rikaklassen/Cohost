Someone made a suggestion on a wish list and going to have to say this:

I literally not accept anything physical from other people. Cannot drive car due to deafblindness. Everything I own can be shoved into a carry-on and checked luggage for airline travel.

In the past, while living with others, we agreed that whatever excess belongs to the other person. So, whatever gift you give me, you are essentially gifting yourself.

Thank you.
