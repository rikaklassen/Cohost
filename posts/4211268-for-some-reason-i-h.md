For some reason, I have no problem trying to fundraise for bestie as a blog post; but reluctant asking the amounts she need in graphics editor (using GIMP, which is similar to Adobe Photoshop). even though I made [a card for myself](https://cohost.org/rikaklassen/post/4059060-tried-to-go-through) on Twitter 5 years ago for laptop replacement required at work.

There is no issue forwarding the paycheques from contract work and the tax returns to her. But having a difficult time asking help from people on the Internet. Much rather find another gig and provide assistance through my own labour.

Like in my head, I know I need to keep bestie [safe from COVID](https://cohost.org/rikaklassen/post/4086052-cw-covid-19-pandemi), help her find a better job in a safer workplace and I don't make enough to support her.

A part of me insists on giving everything I have until there's nothing left before I can ask others to help. But it's not sustainable and burnt out twice before (albeit with different individuals).
