Today I learned Darcy's Wild Life is considered as "[lost media](https://lostmediawiki.com/Darcy%27s_Wild_Life_(found_Family_Channel/Discovery_Kids_teen_sitcom;_2004-2006))" because it was never released to home video. And no one recovered the full series until 2022.

Interesting.

Bestie was complaining last year none of the streaming platforms have the TV series in their catalogues. Did eventually forward her downloaded copies when YouTube kept copyright-striking fans reuploading the episodes.

Sister grew up watching that on Family Channel before going to school.

Was seeing if a VHS or DVD exists for bestie's Christmas. But only the soundtrack is available.
