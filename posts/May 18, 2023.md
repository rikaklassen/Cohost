Supposedly, Google has no plans to delete YouTube videos. Theoretically that dead person's YouTube channel is safe. For now.

Still don't trust Google given its history.

Would still be archiving to Wayback Machine and uploading the videos on Internet Archive for redundancy.

(Update: 63% done archiving the person's Twitter account.)
