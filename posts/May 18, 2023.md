Supposedly, Google has [no plans to delete YouTube videos](https://twitter.com/YouTubeLiaison/status/1658993115657809920). Theoretically that dead person's YouTube channel is safe. For now.

![If you have an existing subscription set up through your Google Account, for example to Google One, a news publication or an app, we also consider this account activity and your account will not be impacted. Additionally, we do not have plans to delete accounts with YouTube videos at this time.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rikaklassen/Cohost/main/pictures/youtubeaccount.webp)

Still don't trust Google given [its history](https://killedbygoogle.com/).

Would still be archiving to Wayback Machine and uploading the videos on Internet Archive for redundancy.

(**Update:** 63% done archiving the person's Twitter account.)
