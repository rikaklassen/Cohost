My friend MK (@these-qualia) took the time to manually caption a 40-minutes video essay examining grief and beliefs in HBO drama The Leftovers (2014 - 2017)  by hand. MK also dove into aspects of their own life.

Would appreciate it if you watch the video and turn on the subtitles.

Content warning for mental health and death. Not including CW on the post itself since one would need to click on the video embed and prompt to play.
