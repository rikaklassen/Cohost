**For transparency:** I am still somewhere between $700 (without laptop) to a little over $2 000 CAD (with laptop) short of the autumn 2021 / spring 2022 goals. 

Not sure if that counts since the person already has a laptop.

Not counting inflation ($809.14 CAD to $955.40 CAD, adjusted for 2023) or rent, utilities, groceries, transportation and other living costs.

(Also, checked, they did ask for help with rent as well. So, gotta make good on that.)
