Content warning: aging companion animal

Just realized Mr. P will be 12 next year. Don't know how much longer he has on this planet.

Wish I have the money to see him in Pylkönmäki (Saarijärvi) before he gets too old.

It's a 6 500 km (4 000 mi) plane trip.

And I am not sure how to get to Saarijärvi from Helsinki (334 km / 208 mi) as a deafblind person.

One of previous partners gave me directions and taught me how to navigate independently, when and where to get off when they dropped me off at a train station in Riihimäki to visit a friend in Ylivieska.

If anyone wants to help, [PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/bglamours) is available.
