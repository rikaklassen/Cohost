Transcript is available [from Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10vwrSnuK_ZWwxl72eOcWHip4WbQLimbqvQHF6lq38QY/edit).

Reshared from [Anna Lim (X/@meixinglingual)](https://twitter.com/meixinglingual/status/1745983083306689018).

Would copy and paste the transcript here, but need to find a more efficient way automate inserting blockquotes in markdown since Cohost doesn't have a WYSIWYG editor like Pillowfort or Tumblr.
