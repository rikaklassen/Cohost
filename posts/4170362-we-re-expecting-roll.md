We're expecting rolling blackouts because the conservative governments didn't have the foresight to invest in anti-fragile grids and anti-fragile infrastructure in preparation for climate change with extremely cold winters and extremely hot summers. Funnily enough, we're being asked to conserve electricity.

We're experiencing -35°C to -45°C with windchills down to -60°C.

If power outages occur, I will not be able to work and [help out](https://cohost.org/rikaklassen/post/3991210-still-owe-the-said-p) my friend with her bills. So, we appreciate anything you can contribute to her [PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/bglamours).

Thank you!
