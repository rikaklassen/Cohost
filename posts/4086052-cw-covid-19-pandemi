Content Warning: COVID-19 pandemic

Anxious about bestie catching COVID at work during the current wave. Wish she doesn't have to be a waitress / bartender.

Hope she stays safe.

If you see me plugging someone's [PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/bglamours), it's so that person can focus on studying in college and find safer jobs after graduating. Promised her that during the surges of winter 2021.

Don't really enjoy being worried about others. Even with a previous partner who was good for me, and was family, I didn't stress out about them whenever they became ill or injured.

I want bestie to have the best life possible.
