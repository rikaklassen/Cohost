!['The Food and Drug Administration, which allowed the CHOP study to go forward, asked that, for safety reasons, the researchers start with older children, not infants, and treat only one ear.  The challenge for the U.S. study was to find older children whose parents would agree to the study, who had otoferlin deafness and who did not have cochlear implants.  Aissam never had cochlear implants. He never had schooling in Morocco to help him develop communication skills. But three years ago, when he was 8, his father, Youssef Dam, a construction worker, got a job in Barcelona, Spain. For the first time, Aissam went to school, enrolling in a school for the deaf, where he learned Spanish Sign Language. Soon after, his family learned of the gene therapy trial.' The section about not attending school until age eight is highlighted.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rikaklassen/Cohost/main/pictures/horrorstoryplot.webp)
![The second section reads: 'But no matter how well the gene therapy works, the researchers recognize that Aissam may never be able to understand or speak a language, Dr. Germiller said. The brain has a narrow window for learning to speak beginning around ages 2 to 3, he explained. After age 5, the window for learning spoken language is permanently shut.  Hearing can still help patients even if they never learn to speak, he noted. They can hear traffic or know when someone is trying to communicate. The ability to hear also can help with lip reading.' The section about window of language acquisition closing is highlighted.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rikaklassen/Cohost/main/pictures/horrorstoryplot1.webp)

This reads like a horror movie plot.

Not really sure what the adults' plans were when they knew that person has [language deprivation syndrome](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yy_K6VtHJw) [[archived](https://web.archive.org/web/20240124103333/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yy_K6VtHJw)] and didn't acquire a language until age eight. Sure, the doctors gave reasoning about giving child access to environmental sounds, but that is not how ableist society treats deaf individuals who only have aural access to environment. Not to mention those with cochlear implants are deemed disposable under capitalism.

My head hurts thinking about the ethical ramification of experimenting on a child who didn't have sign language exposure from birth.

This child is not going to acquire spoken language like a hearing baby or an implanted deaf baby. I genuinely hope the child will be allowed to continue attending a sign language school alongside their deaf peers and receive support throughout the rest of their life.
